# Study Time Optimization System (Machine Learning Project)

A machine learning-based web application designed to analyse student study patterns and predict optimal study time for improved academic performance.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of data preprocessing, model training, and predictive analytics using Python and Django.

## Project Overview

Students often struggle with managing study time effectively.
This system analyses study-related data and predicts optimal study strategies using machine learning techniques.

The application processes student data, trains predictive models, and generates insights that can help improve learning outcomes and time management.
